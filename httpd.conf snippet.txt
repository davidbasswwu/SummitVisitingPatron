# This section is to support David's ezproxy-iii.php script which mimics the
# III Patron API server, against which EZProxy performs Summit authentication
# of visiting patrons. EZProxy doesn't know how authenticate against Alma,
# so ezproxy-iii.php does that for it, while presenting a III Patron API interface
# that EZProxy understands.
# The format of a III Patron API request is:
#   http://www.example.com/PATRONAPI/username/dump
# so that's the only way that EZProxy will format its request.
# The RewriteRule extracts the "username" portion and makes it the query string
# for ezproxy-iii.php.
# This only works in an "Alias" / "<Location>" block like this.
# Trying it in a .htaccess and a <Directory> block was unsuccessful.
